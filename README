NAME
       sloth - slow down a process

SYNOPSIS
       sloth [DELAY(ms)] [PROGRAM]

DESCRIPTION
       Sloth allows you to slow down a specified application by 
       specifying (in miliseconds) the delay on the process. It slows 
       down the process by sending SIGSTOP & SIGCONT signals to the 
       process over a very fast period of time, giving the appearance 
       of a slower application.
   
       The number given (as the first command line argument) will be 
       the wait period before stopping and unstopping the process. 
       The actual time between a stop and an unstop is DELAY * 10. 
   
EXAMPLE
       # sloth 5000 ines Pirates.nes
   
       This command will run the emulator 'ines' with the game 
       'Pirates'. Every 5000ms it will send a SIGSTOP (effectively 
       pausing the game) wait for 50,000ms (n*10), then send a 
       SIGCONT, continuing the process where it left off.
