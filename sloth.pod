=head1 NAME

   sloth - slow down the speed a process runs at

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   sloth [DELAY(ms)] [PROGRAM]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

   Sloth allows you to slow down a specified application by 
   specifying (in miliseconds) the delay on the process. It slows 
   down the process by sending SIGSTOP & SIGCONT signals to the 
   process over a very fast period of time, giving the appearance 
   of a slower application.
   
   The number given (as the first command line argument) will be 
   the wait period before stopping and unstopping the process. 
   The actual time between a stop and an unstop is DELAY * 10. 
   
   Example: sloth 5000 ines Pirates.nes
   
   This command will run the emulator 'ines' with the game 
   'Pirates'. Every 5000ms it will send a SIGSTOP (effectively 
   pausing the game) wait for 50,000ms (n*10), then send a 
   SIGCONT, continuing the process where it left off.
